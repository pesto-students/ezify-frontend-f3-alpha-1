## Technology Stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
* [Socket](https://socket.io/)
